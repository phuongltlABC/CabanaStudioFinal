                Defined by simple lines, neutral colors and an overall lack of visual clutter, minimalist design has dominated interiors in recent years. Think all-white kitchens with marble countertops, muted bedrooms with off-white bedding and neutral living rooms with cream sofas and minimal wall decor. But while certain elements of minimalism are timeless (clean lines and neutral colors will always have their place in home design, for instance), we've noticed that more and more interior designers are nixing the sparse style. Instead, we're seeing joyful, bright and personalized styles taking over the design world now.

            <h3>Why are designers straying from minimalism?</h3>

                    "Minimalist interiors can often feel stiff or museum-like," says Sarah Storms of Styled by Storms. "The colors — cool grieges, blacks and stark white — used in these spaces can feel cold." "Minimalism makes it hard to create different zones and spaces — and they aren't very emotional spaces," adds interior designer Lucinda Sanford. "Today, clients seem to be more open to interiors that look like they can be touched, appreciating designs that can add their own personality to."

                    "A house really needs to give people joy and be inviting," says Sanford, who embellished this dining room with patterned wallpaper, retro dining chairs and colorful artwork.

                    The designers we spoke to say renters and homeowners alike are craving old-world charm through antiques, reupholstery and handcrafted decor — all of which happen to be environmentally friendly choices, too. Another reason for the death of minimalism? The impact COVID-19 had on home design. "People were in their homes so much that the mindset shifted to really investing in our spaces," says Storms. "Even when people started traveling again and returning to the office, the idea of a comfortable home remained."

            <h3>In place of minimalism, what interior styles are trending?</h3>

                    As the desire for personalized spaces filled with color, texture and unique details grows, homeowners are embracing maximalist, eclectic and vintage home styles. That translates to mismatched furniture sets, moody paint colors, natural woods and vibrant patterns.
"Clients are looking for more adult spaces when it comes to entertaining," says Storms. "Places that have design and style, but that your kids can also live in without worry. People also crave homes that reflect themselves. They want to mix in treasures from travels and relatives."

                    Eclectic interiors, typically a combination of old and new pieces, have a way of evoking creativity and comfort, whether through vibrant colors or surprising accents. "This style allows you to break the rules and mix contemporary clean lines with more traditional elements," says Storms. As for why homeowners are trading neutrals for saturated hues, Storms emphasizes that "color evokes emotion within people." She adds, "When you surround yourself with color, whether it's bright or moody, you instantly have a reaction — happiness, comfort, serenity."
